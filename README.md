## Overview

`useMemoReducer` is a React hook engineered to efficiently manage state within a **React Context** by decoupling state updates in your module from the Context's child re-rendering.

Its usage closely mirrors that of `useReducer`, but additionally supports **thunks** and integrates seamlessly with **Redux DevTools** for enhanced debugging.


## Installation

```javascript
npm install use-memo-reducer
```

Import:

```javascript
import { useMemoReducer } from 'use-memo-reducer';
```

## What are you getting?

üéØ **Scoped React Context**: Utilize a React context with a state that is readily available to all its children using a `useSelector()`.

‚ö° **Optimized Rendering**: The state change does not trigger a re-render of all children components, but only those in which the state actually changed, ensuring optimal performance.

‚öôÔ∏è **Support for Thunks**: Leverage thunks for more intricate and asynchronous actions, adding depth to your state management.

‚ôªÔ∏è **Reusable Store**: It‚Äôs highly reusable - the store service you've implemented can be effortlessly reused as many times as you wish across different parts of your application, promoting consistency and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

üîç **Debugging with Redux DevTools**: Gain insights into the state flow by integrating `useMemoReducer`with Redux DevTools. Simply assign meaningful names to your connections, and delve into state transitions, actions, and timelines, all at your fingertips.

Harness the full potential of `useMemoReducer` to build scalable, efficient, and maintainable React applications. [Comparison with Redux and useReducer](https://github.com/piskunovim/useMemoReducer#-benchmark-results).


## Getting Started

Let's create a simple application that will use **React Context** and `useMemoReducer` and will show how child optimised rerendering does work.

[![Edit smoosh-breeze-pcv676](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/smoosh-breeze-pcv676?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fsrc%2FCounter%2Fservices%2FCounterService%2FCounterService.jsx&theme=dark)

Traditionally, React Contexts have had a reputation for being cumbersome when it comes to state storage, mainly due to the challenges in optimizing providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders upon state changes. `useMemoReducer` paves the way for a solution to this issue.

Imagine that we are building a simple counter, and we wish to create a service that allows incrementing and decrementing a value within the state.

```javascript
import React, {
  createContext,
  useContext,
  useCallback,
  useMemo,
  memo,
} from "react";
import { useMemoReducer } from "use-memo-reducer";

export const CounterServiceContext = createContext({});

export const useCounterService = () => useContext(CounterServiceContext);

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export const CounterService = memo(({ children }) => {
  const [useSelector, dispatch] = useMemoReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

  const decrement = useCallback(
    () => dispatch({ type: "decrement" }),
    [dispatch]
  );
  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    dispatch({ type: "increment" });
  }, [dispatch]);

  const contextValues = useMemo(
    () => ({
      useSelector,
      decrement,
      increment,
    }),
    []
  );

  return (
    <CounterServiceContext.Provider value={contextValues}>
      {children}
    </CounterServiceContext.Provider>
  );
});
```

Notably, the service is memoized is memoized to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. `useMemoReducer` seamlessly handles the orchestration of re-rendering processes. All that‚Äôs required on your end is to retrieve the `useSelector` from the context hook within the necessary React component, and then pass the selector to it, akin to the familiar workflow with Redux.

```javascript
const Counter = () => {
  const { useSelector } = useCounterService();

  const count = useSelector((state) => state.count);

  return <span>{count}</span>;
};

const ActionButtons = () => {
  const { decrement, increment } = useCounterService();

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>
      <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

Let‚Äôs integrate this in the counter component.

```javascript
const CounterComponent = () => (
  <CounterService>
    <Counter />
    <ActionButtons />
  </CounterService>
);
```

What we've achieved here is the creation of a localized store dedicated to a set of components. But what‚Äôs even more impressive is the scalability: should you need multiple counters on a single page, simply instantiate this component multiple times. Each counter will maintain its distinct state and independent logic, providing an autonomous ecosystem for each instance.

```javascript
const MainComponent = () => (
  <>
    <CounterComponent />
    <CounterComponent />
  </>
);

createRoot(document.getElementById("app-init")).render(<MainComponent />);
```

This methodology unlocks boundless possibilities for ingenuity and experimentation in your development process.

### Simple component

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use `useMemoReducer` within a simple functional component.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useMemoReducer } from './useMemoReducer';

// Define the initial state
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Define the reducer
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const CounterComponent = () => {
  // Use the useMemoReducer hook
  const [useSelector, dispatch] = useMemoReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  // Select the count value from state
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
      <span>Count: {count}</span>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

In this example, `useMemoReducer` is used similarly to `useReducer`. The difference is that you get a `useSelector` function instead of the state directly. This allows you to selectively pick parts of the state, and your component will only re-render if the selected parts change.

## Thunks

That's right! You can also dispatch a thunk (a function) instead of a plain action. This is useful for performing async actions or computing derived state before dispatching a plain action.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useMemoReducer } from './useMemoReducer';

const initialState = { count: 0, loading: false };

const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'loading':
      return { ...state, loading: true };  
    default:
      throw state;
  }
};

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const [useSelector, dispatch] = useMemoReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const loading = useSelector(state => state.loading);

  // An example thunk to increment the counter after a delay
  const delayedIncrement = (dispatch, getState) => {
    // Dispatch a loading action
    dispatch({ type: 'loading' });

    // After a delay, increment the counter
    setTimeout(() => {
      const currentState = getState();
      if (currentState.loading) {
        dispatch({ type: 'increment' });
      }
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
      <span>Count: {count}</span>
      {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(delayedIncrement)}>Delayed Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CounterComponent;
```

## Integration with Redux DevTools

`useMemoReducer` supports integration with Redux DevTools. Make sure you have the Redux DevTools extension installed in your browser. This allows you to inspect the state and actions, which can be incredibly helpful during development.

In order to enable the integration, you need to pass the `devtoolsName` option to the hook in lowercase. This is the name that will be used to identify your store in the Redux DevTools.

```javascript
const [useSelector, dispatch] = useMemoReducer(counterReducer, initialState, {
  devtoolsName: 'counter',
});
```

## Signature

```typescript
function useMemoReducer<S, A, O>(
  reducer: Reducer<S, A>,
  initialState: S,
  options?: O
): [useSelector: UseSelector<S>, dispatch: Dispatch<S, A>];
```

- **`reducer`**: A reducing function that returns a new state, given the current state and an action.
- **`initialState`**: The initial state to be used for the first render.
- **`useSelector`**: A hook similar to `useSelector` in Redux. It takes a selector function as an argument and returns the selected state. The selector will be re-run whenever an action is dispatched and some part of the state may have changed.
- **`dispatch`**: A dispatch function is responsible for sending actions to the store. It accepts both standard action objects and thunks.

## Types

- **`S`**: The type of state used by the reducer.
- **`A`**: The type of actions that can be dispatched to the reducer.
- **`O`**: The type representing the options for the hook, such as `{ devtoolsName }`.
